#### AFTER (creative rewrite)

```html
<h3 class="title-border">Architectural Consultancy Services</h3>
<p>At Enstructura we partner with experienced architects to design buildings that are beautiful,
                                efficient and future-ready. Our approach blends thoughtful aesthetics with proven
                                sustainability: energy-smart orientation and systems, daylight-first planning, water
                                conservation strategies and low-impact materials. The result is architecture that
                                performs well, costs less to operate, and reduces environmental impact without
                                compromising on form or function.</p>

                                focus on occupant comfort, operational savings and green-rating readiness (IGBC/GRIHA/LEED),
