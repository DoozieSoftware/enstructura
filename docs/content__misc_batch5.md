# Copy rewrite — batch 5 (contact / gallery / testimonial / services-details1 / services-details)

This file contains before/after copy diffs for client review. Only content (copy) is suggested; markup and classes are preserved in the HTML files. After client approval I will apply these edits in-place using exact-context matching.

  Raghuvanahalli (Off Kanakapura Road),
  Bengaluru — 560062

- Contact form button (UX copy suggestion):
  Change button text from `send message` to `Send message` or `Send enquiry` (capitalization and clarity).

## gallery.html

### BEFORE (selected copy extracted)

- The page is primarily an image grid with filter buttons (ALL, High Rise Building, Institutional Projects, Industrial Projects, Hospital Projects, Infrastructure Projects, Water Retaining Structure, NDT Projects, Concrete Structures, Special Structures, Steel Structures). No explicit intro paragraph exists.

### AFTER (proposed creative rewrite)

- Intro paragraph to add above the filter controls:
  "A visual catalogue of our work — from high-rise towers to precision NDT projects. Browse by project type or click any image to view details. Each photograph reflects our focus on structural integrity, constructability and client outcomes."

- Filter button labels: keep the same but consider changing `ALL` to `All projects` for readability.

Notes: this page is image-first — keep captions minimal. Where image alt text is missing, supply descriptive alt text (e.g., "High-rise residential tower — structural framing").

## testimonial.html

### BEFORE (selected copy extracted)

- Page title: "Testimonial"
- Several testimonial blocks with repeated placeholder copy: "Just like to say a big thank you for the quick help & support I got over on the UT support forum..." and client names like "Md. Mahabub Alam", "Robert Stone" with roles: Designer, Manager, etc. Star ratings present.

### AFTER (proposed creative rewrite)

- Page heading (replace):
  "What our clients say"

- Short intro paragraph (new):
  "Reliable, practical, proven — here’s what clients say about partnering with Enstructura. Our work is judged by safety, clarity and the measurable value we deliver on site."

- Example testimonial rewrites (replace repeated placeholder text with varied, believable testimonials):
  - "Enstructura turned a tricky retrofit into a confidence-building plan. Their assessment and drawings reduced our downtime and kept the project on budget." — S. Ramesh, Project Manager
  - "Technically strong and pragmatic — the team explained options clearly and delivered a robust, buildable design." — Leena K., Architect
  - "Their testing and inspection report highlighted risks we would have missed. The recommendations were precise and actionable." — Dr. P. Gupta, Facilities Head

Notes: keep photo and rating UI. Replace repeated placeholder copy with the three varied testimonials above (or client-provided quotes).

## services-details1.html (structural design / structural Design Consultancy page)

### BEFORE (selected copy extracted)

- Headline: "structural Design Consultancy"
- Paragraphs describing the design division, software used (ETABS, SAFE, STAAD.Pro, CYPE, RCDC), CAD/Revit/Sketch-Up usage, constructability focus.
- Sections: Retrofitting Design Expertise, Structural Design, Strengthening & Retrofitting Schemes, Proof Checking, Water-Retaining Structures, Irrigation Structures, Joint Detailing in Steel Structures, and a list of project types (residential, commercial, industrial, silos, irrigation, water treatment).

### AFTER (proposed creative rewrite)

- Headline (polished):
  "Structural Design Consultancy — engineered for safety, clarity and buildability"

- Lead paragraph (replace):
  "Our design studio brings postgraduate expertise and industry-proven tools to every structure we design. Using ETABS, SAFE, STAAD.Pro, RCDC and modern BIM workflows (Revit), we deliver designs that are safe, efficient and easy to build. We focus on practicality — designs that help contractors save time and owners save cost."

- Retrofitting section (replace):
  "Retrofitting expertise: targeted strengthening using concrete encasement, steel plate bonding, carbon-fibre systems and tailored retrofit schemes that meet code and extend asset life. We combine careful analysis with site-aware detailing to minimise disruption."

- Services bullets (clearer, benefit-led):
  - Design of residential, commercial, institutional and hospital buildings
  - Industrial structures, PEB and plant-support systems
  - Silos, bunkers and storage structures
  - Water-retaining structures and irrigation works
  - Proof-checking and peer review for safety and code compliance

Notes: keep the image carousel and galleries. These rewrites are copy-only — no layout changes.

## services-details.html (alternate structural design page)

### BEFORE (selected copy extracted)

- Very similar content to `services-details1.html`: structural design consultancy, software, CAD/Revit use, lists of services and image slider.

### AFTER (proposed consolidated rewrite)

- Headline:
  "Structural design and proof-check — practical engineering, dependable results"

- Lead paragraph (replace):
  "We combine advanced analysis tools with hands-on detailing know-how to produce structural designs that stand up to reality. From concept through fabrication-ready drawings, our approach reduces risk and accelerates construction."

- Short features list (replace existing lists):
  - Comprehensive structural design (RCC, steel & composite systems)
  - Retrofitting and strengthening schemes with proven techniques
  - Proof-checking, peer review and code compliance audits
  - Water infrastructure, irrigation and treatment plant structures

Notes: aim for consistent voice across both `services-details` pages to avoid duplication and help SEO — choose one canonical page if needed.
