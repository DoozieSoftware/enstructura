## Services — Batch 3 (before / after)

Summary: Proposed creative rewrites for the next set of service pages. Each section shows the essential original copy (BEFORE) and a concise, benefit-led replacement (AFTER). These swaps are designed to fit directly into the existing HTML structure (same headings / classes).

### File: technical_training.html

#### BEFORE

```html
<h3 class="title-border">Technical Training </h3>
<p>At Dr. CSV Training Center, we offer specialized technical training for practicing
  engineers, enabling them to enhance their knowledge with the latest available resources.
  Our comprehensive programs include hands-on training in leading structural analysis and
  design software such as ETABS, SAFE, STAAD, CYPE, and Revit.</p>
<p>We also provide expert guidance in retrofitting design and the application of
  construction chemicals used in new construction, retrofitting, and waterproofing works.
</p>
```

#### AFTER (creative rewrite)

```html
<h3 class="title-border">Technical Training</h3>
<p>Our practical training programs upskill practising engineers with hands-on workshops in
  ETABS, SAFE, STAAD, CYPE and Revit. Courses are focused on real project workflows so
  participants leave ready to apply new skills immediately.</p>
<p>We also teach retrofit design principles and the correct selection and use of construction
  chemicals for repair, strengthening and waterproofing — giving engineers the technical
  judgement to specify robust, buildable solutions.</p>

Notes and next steps:
- These After snippets are written to drop into the existing HTML without markup changes.
- If you prefer shorter blurbs for a tighter layout or SEO keyword variations, tell me the target
  keywords and desired length and I’ll produce alternates.
- After you review, reply with "apply" and I will safely patch each HTML file (matching exact
  context) and produce a changelog.
